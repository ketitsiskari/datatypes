# Data types

## Tasks

### Back to front string
Create the function "backToFront" which gets a string and symbols count. And it should return a string. 
For example:
```js
backToFront('hello', 1); // ohelloo
backToFront('abc', 3); // abcabcabc
backToFront('world', 2); // ldworldld
backToFront('world', 20); // world
```

### Nearest number
Create the function "nearest" to find a value which is nearest to z from two given values (x and Y);
For example:
```js
nearest(100, 22, 122); // 122;
nearest(50, 22, 122); // 22;
```


### Remove array duplicates
Create the function "removeDuplicate" to remove all duplicated values from array; do not use a set.
For example:
```js
removeDuplicate([1,2,3,2,3,1,1]); // [1,2,3]
removeDuplicate(['a', 1, '2', 'b', 1, '2', 'b']); // ['a', 1, '2', 'b']
```

Write your code in `src/index.js.
*All test cases are designed as “error-free”, so don't worry about handling any errors.*

## Prepare and test
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)   
2. Fork this repository: data-types
3. Clone your newly created repo: https://gitlab.com/<%your_gitlab_username%>/data-types/  
4. Go to folder `data-types`  
5. To install all dependencies use [`npm install`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install)  
6. Run `npm test` in the command line  
7. You will see the number of passing and failing tests

## Submit to [AutoCode](https://autocode.lab.epam.com/)
